Jesus, today was pulling teeth.
I needed to pomodoro hard and this... this is the last 5 minutues of my 4th one.
Took hours to get 4 pomodoros.

Anyway, today's topics were :

1) Objects.

2) Methods.

3) This.

4) For Loops.

5) While Loops.

...

Objects are .. well.. containers of data. They can have just about anything inside.
you can call this data using ".property" dot.notation - strings, arrays, other objects, numbers, everything.
You make objects with curly {} braces.

Now, there is another topic of OBJECT LITERAL v OBJECT SYNTAX,
and I don't really understand the difference honestly.

Methods are functions within objects.
I did a big-ass coding challenge and got it pretty good.
Perfectly, actually... but it took a handful of attempts, and bugsquashing.

Then we got onto Loops. I was already pretty fucking burnt.
For loops, i = 0 counter, i++, etc.
This I understood mostly - even using the limiter (>) with array.length.

While loops,  I admit - I mostly was toast. The notation is somewhat different.

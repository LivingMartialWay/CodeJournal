1) Script tags can also point to SRC, and load external files/scripts to keep your code cleaner.

2) JavaScript is Object-oriented. Works with both Client&Server ( thanks to node )
and interacts with React, Angular, and other frameworks.
Html = Noun , CSS = Adjectives, and JS = Verbs.

3) Five Datatypes. Number. String. Boolean. Undef. Null.
    JavaScript auto-detects the datatype, so be careful.

4) Variable naming is an art. It's the human legibility.

5) Use camelCase in JS by convention.

6) // = Comments and /*
                        Multiple line commentout
                              */

7) Type Coercion. Forces some variables into other datatypes when required.
    Booleans, Undef, numbers. everything.

8) Prompt.  Prompts the user for info.

9) Math Operators

10) Logic operators create boolean values

11) TypeOf =  Shows what datatype you have onhand

12) Operator Presidence = like order of operations

13) Associativity == math goes right to left, but assignment goes right to left.

14) More Operators

15) Code challenge

    Var = johnHeight, johnWeight, markHeight, markWeight;
    johnHeight = 1.7; //meters
    johnWeight = 60;  //kg
    markHeight = 1.8; //meters
    markWeight = 69; // kg

    johnBMI = (johnWeight)/(johnHeight*johnHeight)
    markBMI = '' ''

    johnFatter = (johnBMI > markBMI)

    console.log('is john fatter than mark?' + johnFatter)

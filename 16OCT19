Created Master @ Local
Created first entry, 16OCT19

Basically started history. From today onward, we'll be open-public learning JavaScript,
and the world of programming, and posting this shit open-source to GitHub.
Gotta make those boxes Green!


I think the first task:  Harvard CS50 via EDX.
Lets go investigate: 11:11 Start.

11:50 ::
10 Weeks of courses.
Although a week is basically 2h of work.
I could do this course in TWO WEEKS, at 2H/DAY.


FIRST GOAL :  HARVARD CS50  by  OCT 30th.  (Extra Credit by 26th!)
SECOND GOAL : JavaScript for Cats.


JavaScript for Cats is ... who knows. Measure your ability to focus while completing.
Then tomorrow we'll make a prediction.

The idea is to spend 4-6hrs on this stuff, but daily - minus shabbas.
End Entry.

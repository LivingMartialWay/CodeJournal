2nd day of React Course.

We're all the way through section 5, and that's pretty good. 
Mostly taking *DOUBLE* the time listed... 

I took a bunch of notes in my React.JS journal, and most of it is very easy.
I think some of my training back from DEV.INSTITUTE was helpful, and 

TODAYS MATERIAL OF REACT PROPS AND STATE

..was fairly easy. 

We even got into conditional rendering.
That was the last lesson, and it was basically IF STATEMENTS.

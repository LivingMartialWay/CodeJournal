Wow, today we did six straight hours of programming for the first time.
Can you imagine - doing 6 straight hours of coding without distraction or cheating?
First day I ever done something like that -- save code school, with was monsterous.

On my own discipline!

Now we have 4 more days to solidify these gains.
BRO-- ACCOMPLISHING THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS AND LEVEL UP!

TWO WEEKS OF 0600 and 6hrs straight? Man's that's close to full-time job status.
And definately ... everyone wasting 2h of work on bullshit, man, I promise.

by the way, promises are difficult shit, but that ES8 syntax is neat.

Today was recursion, closures, like 3h of web challenges, and then another 2h of
watching all that Section 8 shit again.

I might come back and attack more of those FCC challenges. I want to be DONE w/ that shit.
anyway, this is going on git.

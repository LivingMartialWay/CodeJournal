MUSIC: Russian Circles (new)

Fucking hate basic ass HTML.
I fuckin' know it. Everyone fuckin' knows it. This shit is simple and stupid.
Nobody fuckin' uses this shit, it's all div soup and custom elements. The fuck.

We're 36 minutes deep ... (34:40) into this fucking lesson, and I've blown the
first part of HTML out of the fuckin' water, I'll have 26 uploads to GitHub today.

HOLY SHIT, So I uploaded 26 files into 1 commit... and got 1 commit. That's a
learning moment! Anyway, I filled out the very first and most basic element of
FCC today. I wonder if I should go on?

...what the fuck kind of question is that? Ofcourse you go on. What else is there
to do? Doesn't matter if your work is over-efficient, or unbalanced or fuckallelse.

I'm actually really pleased with how easy it is to store thoughts and record your
own learning and TODO's. This really does expedite the learning process, and having
all of it documented will be absolutely critical to showing some

... you can't type like this in public form, dude.

==== OKAY, part 2, CSS ===== (48:30)
Inline CSS selectors? You gotta be kidding me. No fuckin' way.
That shit is re... old.   Lets blow through them, on your mark, SET ... GO!
(49:15)

1:00:23 *sigh* continue... You must. You just must. Try for 2 hours. 56 min more.

49 more min! 16/44
40 more min! 27/44
 Basically at this point they are getting at specificity of CSS styles, which
 is something that I'm already familiar with thanks to Nik and some other places.
 Then onto inline style? Fuck that. just !important them, or USE BETTER CSS.
 Man! this music is good! Russian Circles - Carpe! 4min Mark!

1:27:01 - music is good, and the fuckin' lessons are easy. I guess I owe Nik
more than I imagine. I got through so much fuckin' code learning that shit...

NOBODY WOULD EVER WRITE CSS LIKE THIS!!! It's TOTALLY REDICULOUS!

1:46:00 DONE AND UPLOADED TO GITHUB.
Looks like we get a break, before we ... go to code 2?

We could also just be "done" for the day.

Seriously, pity the fuckin' fool that takes 300 hours to complete these challenges!
I'll spend maybe... 7 or 8 on this shit, and move on!

Yeah. Break time. Easy day.

2hrs to do both HTML and CSS? Nice!

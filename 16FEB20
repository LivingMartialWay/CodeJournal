Started at 930, with Shlomit doing her work.
Going for 5-6 pomodoros this week per day.

Started by reviewing and fixing the last day's (14FEB20) work, coding challenge 5.
Turns out a little minor syntactical error (missing curly bracket after FOR loop)
will cause an entire fuckload of problems, that aren't necessarily reported by the browser's console
as errors!!  That's a huge lesson!  Some errors are not reported!!  You need to code perfectly.

anyway, we're progressing on!

The theoretical JavaScript chapter was a bit complex.

Execution Stack.
Hoisting.
Scope & Lexical scope.
This.

All of it makes pretty good sense, because of the times at Developers Institute.
I intuitively understand most of this. It wasn't even that complex.
Hoisting being the most unclear, lecture #39 would clarify (also, a neat google search?)

We're now moving onto DOM manipulation.

OKAY! HOLY SMOKES.. the second part of today's learning got really complex, really fucking quick.
  math.
  querySelector  (plus editing this selector conditionally~)
  getElementByID
  callback functions / anonymous functions
  adding css classes on conditions
  adding strings and stylings.
  HOLY FUCKING SMOKES.

  Everything in SECTION 4 NEEDS TO BE GONE OVER, FINE TOOTH COMB STYLE.
  I think that tomorrow we'll rewatch all these section 4 lectures and get'er'done.
  Acutally, alot of it made sense.

  This is actually quite complex, but tomorrow we will re-review all these sections.

Alright, we're back at it again, this time doing the FCC's Applied Visual Design.
We've got about 1h, maybe 1.5hs to put at it... and I'd like to see it all done!

We've got Polyphia "resistance" on the radio, and GO! 8:31am

This is really fun, easy, and going well. (8:41)

WOW! The linear gradient CSS feature is really cool. Look into that, it'll help.
The very next exercise .. that shit got totally fuckin' wack and over complicated.

Well, I put exactly 1 hour into this, and now I'm going to shower.
I got 38/52 exercises done, and learned that I can't record music in ScreenCap
and then upload that shit to youtube, because it copyright violates.

We are finally getting into the more complex elements of computer programming,
and I feel that I'll be quickly up to speed on these visual design elements
and then quickly jutted over to JavaScript, and we'll be starting a real realm of
programming over there.

I'm making lots of contributions to github, and that's a positive thing. I'll make
another before I go... right ... NOW!

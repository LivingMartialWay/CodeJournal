14)  IF/ELSE IF/ELSE ... are evaluators!  You can sort data into stages of evaluations.

15) AND / OR / NOT ( && / || / ! )
    are logic evaluators / modifiers which extend evaluations by rubric.
    AND meaning both have to be true to return true
    OR meaning one or another have to return true
    ! simply inverts

  16) Ternary operator - is a very condensed "If Else" block.
      CONDITION ? IF BLOCK : ELSE BLOCK

      So this keeps code condensed and neat, for simple logic/variable conditionals.

  17) Switch. Much like if/elseif/else evaluator, this swaps out the imput between
        CASES and evaluates, or DEFAULTS.

  18) Truthy || Falsy  -- Some things evaluate falsy by nature: Undef, Null, NaN, 0, and ''.

  19) Equality operators "==" equals something because use of TYPE COERCION
                        "===" DOES NOT equal something, because it doesn't TYPE COERCE

  20) Functions. Are machines. Imputs and outputs,
        it's important to note, there is a difference between EXPRESSIONS + STATEMENT
        Expressions MUST prouduce a value/result
        while statements/declarations are static until needed/called and do not neccisarily product results.




//*
John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points,
while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.

1. Calculate the average score for each team
2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console.
 Also include the average score in the output.
3. Then change the scores to show different winners.
Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)

4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points.
Like before, log the average winner to the console.
HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision.
If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)
5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

Corona Virus Coding.

React LifeCycle - interesting topic.
Basically :
  Constructor
  Render()
  DidMount
  DidUpdate
  DidUnmount
  
  
  React Passing-State-as-Props.
  You can pass state into a component by using prop-like syntax.
  <SeasonDisplay /> becomes <SeasonDisplay lat={this.state.lat} /> 
  isn't that fun?


When you initialize State, you can so outright as a constructor, or just declare it... and Babel will make it a constructor. 

There's all sorts of shit here, check my paper notes in my React Book.

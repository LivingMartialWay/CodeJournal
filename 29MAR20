To be honest - at 2131hrs it's tough to remember what we did at 0600.


SO - Today:
We polished off the ES6 Chapter.
that took forever. Those chapter are fuckin' awful. Jesus Christ, but we got through it.
Tomorrow it's direct into the code challenges. CRUSH KILL BLOW THRU.

Then we'll finish off the SECTION 8 and all that bullshit.

Then we attacked the FCC challenges. We're going to need to do 4h & 4h...
ATTACK THESE UNTIL THEY ARE DONE.

THEN THE REACT. THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A MATTER OF 2-3 WEEKS.

ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK

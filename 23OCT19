First day waking up early to do code.
Starting to process this. Every day incremental progress. It's going to work!
Today we started at 0600hrs to watch the 2h "Lecture 1" which has gleefully
glided into loops, for, ints, strings, elses, lots of stuff.
Was an Unbelievablely efficient transition into these materials and some of
the cleanest learning I've seen in this realm.

Going to take a break one hour in. Actually I'm writing it now.
Resume 0720.

THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN! Talked w/ shlomit instead.
Resuming 0850


So - the last half of the presentation was fine, you can see in my notes what
was covered. I basically have this knowledge, which I'm quite happy about.
I really would like to get into some syntatical battles with problems to test
my mettle against the machine. I ... Probably... should... search for that!

JS TACTICS!
